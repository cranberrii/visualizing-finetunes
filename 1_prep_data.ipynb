'' the researchers tested their thesis by showing 82 college students 40 photographs -- some of highly pleasant images , such as children with kittens , and some of highly unpleasant images , such as children who were malnourished . half of the participants in the study were given `` an acute dose '' of acetaminophen -- 1,000 milligrams -- and the other half were given a placebo with the same appearance . the subjects were then asked to rate the photos according to how unpleasant or pleasant they were . those who took the acetaminophen rated all the photos less extremely than those who took the placebo . `` in other words , positive photos were not seen as positively under the influence of acetaminophen and negative photos were not seen as negatively , '' the authors reported . the researchers followed up by testing a group of 85 people to see whether this change in judgment applied just to emotions or whether the drug blunted people 's evaluation of magnitude in general . this group showed the same blunting of emotional reactions . but acetaminophen did not affect how much blue they saw in each photo . but people who participated in the study did not appear to know they were acting differently , said baldwin way , an assistant professor of psychology who was another of the study 's authors . `` most people probably are n't aware of how their emotions may be impacted when they take acetaminophen , '' way said . each week , about 23 % of american adults -- or 52 million people -- use a medicine containing acetaminophen , according to the nonprofit consumer healthcare products association . the authors said it was not known whether other pain relievers , such as ibuprofen and aspirin , have the same effect . but have no fear -- they plan to study that question , as well .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"list_choices\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"correct_choice\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"<t> `` the late show with david letterman '' concludes may 20 . </t> <t> letterman 's guests will include oprah winfrey and bill murray . </t> <t> stephen colbert takes over the slot september 8 . </t>\",\n          \"<t> `` twin peaks '' creator david lynch announced he was departing the showtime revival of the cult series sunday . </t> <t> cast members of the show posted a video pleading for him to return .</t>\",\n          \"<t> subjects taking acetaminophen reacted less strongly to both pleasant and unpleasant photos . </t> <t> each week , 52 million americans use the pain reliever . </t> <t> unknown whether other pain products produce the same effect . </t>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

You don't get that kind of emotional confidence from being online.\\\"\\nIf your online activity is leaving you feeling anxious, Dr Radha has advised that you should \\\"slowly try to wean yourself off it\\\".\\nShe said: \\\"If you are worrying, 'what's going on? What am I missing?'

There were tens of thousands of accounts.\\nOfficers with Task Force Argos in Australia knew the creator of the site used an unusual greeting - the word \\\"hiyas\\\".\\nAfter exhaustively trawling chatrooms and forums in the open internet, they found a Facebook page of a man who used the same greeting.\\nAlthough the Facebook page was fake, they identified a picture of a vehicle and that led them to a man called Shannon McCoole - a childcare worker in Adelaide.\\nWhen officers went through his door, he was actually online running the site.\\nThey took detailed photographs of McCoole's hands. This is where the freckle comes in - one on his finger matched exactly one seen in many of the images of abuse.\\nIn an unprecedented move, Task Force Argos assumed McCoole's identity and took over the running of the site.\\nLast year he was given a 35-year prison sentence.\\nOne user who stood out was Huckle - given the number of children he had access to and his aggressive attitude.\\nUsing data gleaned from the site and information Huckle had posted on social media and other open internet sites, they identified who he was and where he lived.\\nRealising he was coming back to the UK for the Christmas holidays in 2014, they tipped off Britain's National Crime Agency.\\nAs he landed at Gatwick airport he was met by officers from the NCA's Child Exploitation and Online Protection command.\\nOn his computer and encrypted drives they found tens of thousands of obscene images and videos.\",\n          \"Speaking on TV, Maria Zakharova said Jews had told her they donated both to Mr Trump and Hillary Clinton.\\nShe joked that American Jews were the best guide to US politics.\\nThe diplomat's remarks caused shock. Anti-US propagandists in the last century peddled an idea that rich New York Jews controlled US politics.\\nMs Zakharova was speaking on a chat show on Russian state TV at the weekend but her comments drew more attention after being picked up by media outlets on Thursday.\\nShe said she had visited New York with an official Russian delegation at the time of the last UN General Assembly, in September.\\n\\\"I have a lot of friends and acquaintances there, of course I was interested to find out: how are the elections going, what are the American people's expectations?\\\" she said.\\n\\\"If you want to know what will happen in America, who do you need to talk to? You have to talk to the Jews, of course. It goes without saying.\\\"\\nAt this, the TV studio audience applauded loudly.\\n\\\"I went here and there among them, to chat,\\\" she continued.\\nImitating a Jewish accent, Mrs Zakharova said Jewish people had told her: \\\"'Marochka, understand this - we'll donate to Clinton, of course. But we'll give the Republicans twice that amount.' Enough said!
